							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello! I am James G Homan. I am a studying Software Developer at SUNY at Brockport. I started studying programming languages as a high schooler, and have since developed a wide understanding of many 
							languages. These include Java, C++, Assembly, Python, C, R, HTML-5, XML, CSS, LabVIEW, LISP, Prolog, and C#. I have also spent time developing code in systems like Unix, Linux, and Windows 10/11.<br><br>
							
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've strived to work with a variety of API's to learn how to incorporate external calls and libraries into my code. Some API's I have worked with would include Spotify, Discord, and Lunar API.<br><br>
							
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the Software I am familiar with would be any python IDE, Intellij, Git, RStudio, LISP Works and more!<br><br>
